## Overview

The order configuration section in Fleetbase is the backbone of what fields are included when a new order is created, the activity flow and the activity statuses of the orders, and also the type of entity that is attached to the order. 

When creating a new order, once you specify the order type, this will pull in the fields and logic configured in that particular order configuration.
